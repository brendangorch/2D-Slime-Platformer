# 2D-Slime-Platformer
A simple 2D platformer game that I made with the Godot engine using its built-in scripting language GDScript. All sprites drawn by me in photoshop. The player jumps from platform to platform and if they fall off, they respawn at the beginning. Currently not a finished project, but I will likely come back to it in the near future.
